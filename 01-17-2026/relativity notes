### 1. Definition of Mandelstam Variables
Consider a two-body collision or scattering (2 → 2 process):
     Reaction: A + B → C + D
Four-momenta: p1 = A, p2 = B, p3 = C, p4 = D

Mandelstam variables are defined as:
     s (total energy squared)
     s = (p1 + p2)^2
Corresponds to the total energy squared in the center-of-mass (COM) frame 
Determines whether the reaction has enough energy

     t (momentum transfer)
     t = (p1 - p3)^2 = (p2 - p4)^2
Describes the "exchange" or scattering process A → C
Directly related to the scattering angle θ in the COM frame

     u (another momentum transfer)
     u = (p1 - p4)^2 = (p2 - p3)^2
Describes the "exchange" process A → D

Relation:
     s + t + u = m1^2 + m2^2 + m3^2 + m4^2

Note: Knowing any two Mandelstam variables allows calculation of the third.

### 2. Relation between t and Scattering Angle (COM Frame)
In the COM frame:
     Total momentum of A and B is zero
     Scattering angle θ = angle of A → C
     For elastic scattering (m1 = m3):
     E1 = E3 → (E1 - E3)^2 = 0
     |p1 - p3|^2 = 2 p^2 (1 - cos θ)
     Therefore, t = - 2 p^2 (1 - cos θ)
     The relation between t and θ is very useful in competition-style problems.

### 3. u Variable and Crossed Channel
     u = (p1 - p4)^2
     In the COM frame: u = - 2 p^2 (1 + cos θ)
     t and u symmetrically describe which particle is being exchanged
In Feynman diagrams:
     t-channel → t variable
     u-channel → u variable

### 4. Summary
s → Determines if there is enough energy to produce new particles
t → Momentum transfer corresponding to scattering angle θ
u → Momentum transfer corresponding to crossed particle exchange
In the COM frame:
t = -2 p^2 (1 - cos θ)
u = -2 p^2 (1 + cos θ)
s = (E1 + E2)^2
These formulas allow rapid calculation of scattering angles from t, or momentum transfer from angles, and are very useful for relativistic physics competitions.
